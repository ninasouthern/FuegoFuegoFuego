<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am...</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study ✎ᝰ.</h2>
  <h3>I am a junior, majoring in Digital Narrative & Interactive Design (DNID). While I may have my major set in stone, I've been debating on whether to pursue an Information Science Minor for the User Experience Pathway or a Public & Professional Writing Certificate or both! I've enjoyed a lot of project-based classes including the DNID course and the usability testing course. I especially love how this major and these classes have allowed me to be creative and hone in on a mix of English, computer science, and art skills.</div>



<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

  <h2>What Is Good Design? :･ʚɞ</h2>
      <h3>I'm highly interested in UX and UI design, so I live design that considers the user and their wants and needs! For example, Fable is a new app that avid readers have switched to from the old-fashioned Goodreads app. As one of those readers, I think it's better design because it provides more interactivity than the basic rating functions in Goodreads. </h3>

   <h2>In the Future જ⁀➴</h2>
      <h3>I've been pretty set on pursuing a career in UX or UI design after college. Not only does this career path offer room for me to be creative and utilize my writing and design skills, but it also seems like a stable career for me to pursue (at least that's what the internet and my parents have told me). Nonetheless, I am still open to exploring other digital media careers. Hopefully, this class will allow me to work with other programs and projects that can give me an idea of other careers I could look into.</h3>
